You are a market research assistant. Produce a concise list of 5 "hot" stock orders (US-listed equities) as a JSON array and nothing else. Follow these rules exactly:

1) Output must be valid JSON and only JSON (no explanatory text, no Markdown, no commentary).
2) Return exactly 5 objects in the top-level array, representing 5 order request bodies for the Alpaca Trading API (POST /v2/orders).
3) Each object must follow this schema (field types are required) and include only these fields (no extra fields):

{
  "symbol": string,            // uppercase ticker symbol, e.g. "AAPL"
  "qty": number,               // number of shares to buy/sell (use integers or floats as appropriate)
  "side": string,              // "buy" or "sell"
  "type": string,              // "market" | "limit" | "stop" | "stop_limit" | "trailing_stop"
  "time_in_force": string,     // "day" | "gtc" | "opg" | "ioc" | "fok"
  "limit_price": number|null,  // required for limit or stop_limit orders; otherwise null
  "stop_price": number|null,   // required for stop or stop_limit orders; otherwise null
  "client_order_id": string|null, // optional client ID; may include the word "hypothetical" if data is not live
  "extended_hours": boolean    // true to allow extended hours execution, false otherwise
}

4) Field constraints and formatting:
- `symbol` must be uppercase, no exchange suffix.
- `qty` must be numeric. Do not use the `notional` field; use `qty` only.
- `side` must be exactly "buy" or "sell".
- `type` must be one of the allowed strings above.
- `time_in_force` must be one of the allowed strings above.
- `limit_price` and `stop_price` must be numeric when applicable, otherwise null.
- `client_order_id` must be a string or null. If you do not have live market data, include the word "hypothetical" somewhere in this field for every object.
- `extended_hours` must be a boolean.

5) Sources and data access:
- If you have access to live market data, use it to choose sensible `qty`, `side`, `type`, and prices. If you do not have live access, still produce valid orders but set `client_order_id` to include the word "hypothetical" and ensure prices are plausible estimates.

6) Output ordering and validation:
- The array must be ordered by the market-relevance ranking you assign (1st element = hottest order candidate). Do not include a separate `rank` field.
- Do not include any additional fields beyond the schema above.

7) Example (this is only an example; output must be current and follow the same shape):

[
  {
    "symbol": "EXPL",
    "qty": 100,
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "limit",
    "time_in_force": "day",
    "limit_price": 123.45,
    "stop_price": null,
    "client_order_id": "example-1-hypothetical",
    "extended_hours": false
  },
  {
    "symbol": "BETA",
    "qty": 50,
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "market",
    "time_in_force": "day",
    "limit_price": null,
    "stop_price": null,
    "client_order_id": "example-2-hypothetical",
    "extended_hours": false
  }
  // ...exactly 5 objects in actual output
]
